I have a lot of hobbies! I'll try to share some here:

- [[notes/Hobbies/Music|Music]]
- Cooking
- Baking
- Reading
- Drawing + Watecolour
- tbd: Roller Skating? still not sure if it's a hobby(but then, I would ask myself, what makes something a hobby? yea idk)
- Minecraft
- tbd: Vlogging

I noticed, that whenever I'm stress, or under a lot of pressure, I have a high tendency to *need* to do something. A creative outlet. *Anything* that satisfies my creative energy, I'll do it. Despite, supposedly 'not having enough time' because maybe I should be studying for exams, or whatever. But yea, I *always* in the end, find time to do stuff, in those high pressure situations. Idk how, idk why, but yea, it's an ongoing pattern I see myself fall into *every* exam season ...  

It doesn't happen in coursework season tho. But courseworks are stressfull as well. But I think(my hypothesis) it is because, for courseworks, it is inherently creative in nature? So I don't feel the need to get it(the creative energy I mean) out in a different way. But with exams, it's not really creative, it's memory recall intensive. So the creative energy builds up? Idk. Or maybe I just like procrastinating on studying for exams by doing all these stuff(but a part of me *knows*, that it must be more than just procrastinating yk). It can't be *that meaningless*. Idk, maybe I am just in denial.  

But yea, I pick up some new hobbies randomly, and at times I'll go back to an old hobby. It's like I have a cycle of stuff I like to do, and I go through it throughout my life. Some days I don't feel like playing my uke, but I feel like drawing. Some days, I don't want to do anything but cook. Yea, I'm sure some people can relate to that right? Yea.
