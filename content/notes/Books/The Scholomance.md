I am currently reading the last book, after leaving it for 3 months because I hate the author for killing off my favourite hero.  

I finally got around to reading it now, because I was having flashbacks of scenes from the book for the past couple of days, and that's usually a sign that I'm ready to pick that book up again. So yea. Love the book.  

And it turns out that there's a possibility the heroin, El Galdriel Higgins, can 'save' the hero in a way. Well not *save*. In this context, she can kill off the monster that devoured him and make sure that he is dead fr. But yea, there's a glimmer of hope there xD. I'm really excited to know what will happen. I really do wish the hero, Orion, will come back! I really love their dynamic, El and Orion. :')

Maybe I'd known all the along that they would come with me, and I'd only told myself that I'd stop them because it was horribly [[notes/Life/Selfish|selfish]] to drag them along, and so I'd had to pretend I wasn't going to do it. I imagine it's always easier to do something monstrous if you can convince yourself you aren't going to, up to the last minute, until you do.

My first highlight in the book.  

I am currently 70% in the book, and let me tell you, Orion lives! I feel like it's been a while since I've lied down and read a book, and I've forgotten how much I love to do that. This book is really really making my imaginations go wild rn. Love it.  

Currently, El is on a quest with her friends to save her ally/friend, Liu. Sounds like something much terrible than death is going on? I'm not sure, but what would a *sacrifice* mean. Like, if you just need a sacrifice, just get some random person no? I'm not sure, why does it need to be someone from the family? And why is the family against it? Didn't they sign up for this in the first place when you're dwelling with making an enclave? Cus an enclave needs malia after all.

DAMN.  
I'm 80% in and DAMN.  
So much going on. Orion is a living, walking, breathing, perfectly human-looking *mawmouth*???  
And Liu almost got *turned into a mawmouth*???  
wth?!  
Enclaves are built on *making mawmouths*????!
This is WILD! 

And BTW, the scene, where El built her first Golden Enclave to save Beijing Enclave, GOLD.  
I cried reading that scene, it was too beautiful. Wow.  

DAMN. Enclaves built from malia have a very dark story behind it.  
Indeed, being turned into a mawmouth, *deathlessness, eternal life, longevity*, is worse than death. Wow, I didn't expect that one bit. I was wondering before, what could be worse than death, and yep, this is miles worse than death.
