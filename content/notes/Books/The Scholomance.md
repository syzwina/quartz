I am currently reading the last book, after leaving it for 3 months because I hate the author for killing off my favourite hero.  

I finally got around to reading it now, because I was having flashbacks of scenes from the book for the past couple of days, and that's usually a sign that I'm ready to pick that book up again. So yea. Love the book.  

And it turns out that there's a possibility the heroin, El Galdriel Higgins, can 'save' the hero in a way. Well not *save*. In this context, she can kill off the monster that devoured him and make sure that he is dead fr. But yea, there's a glimmer of hope there xD. I'm really excited to know what will happen. I really do wish the hero, Orion, will come back! I really love their dynamic, El and Orion. :')
