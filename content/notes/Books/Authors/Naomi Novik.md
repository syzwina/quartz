Really feeling like reading Uprooted now xD.  
And Temeraire too!   

She mentions a lot about fanfictions. And thta really reminded me of wattpad. I feel old now, but it's an app I used a lot to read a lot in my teens. There were tons of fanfictions about stuff. Personally, I don't really like reading fanfictions, it feels odd to me, but some people do. I used to like reading supernatural books written by independent authors. Some of them are really really good.

I remember some:
- A stolen kiss, A stolen crown (2 books series)
- Supernatural academy(? not sure of the name, but really cool book about powers etc.)
