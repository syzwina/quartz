# Dune, Dune #1
It took me 3 months to finish this book. It's a REALLY GOOD BOOK, but I was just struggling out of my reading slump by then. I really love the way the writer portrays the scene and the emotions each character was feeling.  

I picked this one up, with *no expecatations*. So I was really surprised to see Islamic terms showing up in the book. Turns out this series is highly influenced by the middle eastern culture and such. Very good book! HIghly recommend!  

I really want to write down all the quotes for this book, but I sent the book home when my parents came to the UK to visit me. So yea, I'll write t down this summer hopefully.
# Dune Messiah, Dune #2
I am reading this one currently, although I may have stopped for a bit due to exams(well actually no, not because of exams, I just don't feel like reading this days). But yea, will come back to it soon.

> Part of her hold on him lay in the fact that he so seldom needed his tension-building powers with her. Chani mostly avoided indiscreet questions. She maintained a Freemen sense of good manners. Hers were more often practical questions. What interested Chani were facts which bore on the position of her man - his strength in Council, the loyalty of his legions, the abilities and talents of his allies. Her memory held catalogs of names and cross-indexed details. She could rattle off the major weakness of every known enemy, the potential dispositions of opposing forces, battle plans of their military leaders, the tooling and production capacities of basic industries.
