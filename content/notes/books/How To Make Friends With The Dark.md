title: "How To Make Friends With The Dark"

Author: Kathleen Glasgow  

I think this book is a famous one. I was 30% in and then I stopped because it was getting a bit too much for me ...

I cried, each time I picked it up. And my mood was noticeably low as I'm reading it that my friends told me to stop reading it for a while. Yea. It was bad. Which meant, IT'S A GOOD BOOK!
