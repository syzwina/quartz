I LOVE this pancakes! I got this recipe from this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/18Q2xVQoNfA)!   
I found this recipe when I was little, and have been using it since!  

Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup milk
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup melted butter

Note:  
- Sometimes I opt out all-purpose flour + baking powder + baking soda for 1 1/2 cups of self raising flour, most times because I am just lazy to deal with extra ingredients, it turns out fine! However, if you are making this for yourself, and you'll store the batter in the fridge, going for the all-purpose flour + baking powder + baking soda combination is better, because the rising property stays(alive?) for longer. If you use self-raising flour, after a few days, the batter won't rise anymore. But I just eat it anyways despite it not rising, still tastes good tho, so yea.  
- To have it perfectly round sizes, pour the batter into a 3/4 measuring cup, on a hot pan, pour the batter from the measuring cup in the middle of the pan, and let it expand into a circle on its own. Once the batter starts looking bubbly, flip it! And you'll have nice consistently sized pancakes!
