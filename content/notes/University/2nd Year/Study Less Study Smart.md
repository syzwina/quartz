Personally, I can't focus if I just don't want to study. I prefer to go do just *whatever* I want first, until I exhaust it all, and reach a point where I just don't want to do anything else, but study.   

However, yes of course, sometimes(or maybe most of the time) I am constrained by time. But, playing that game for an hour is still possible, as long as you go back to studying right after. Reading that book, for a few minutes won't take that long. Making yourself a good meal won't take that long. All these would boost your mood and make you happy. And if you're happy or in an overall good mood, you can study!  

And making sure you are happy while studying is important, because you don't want 'studying' to be a chore. You want to be able to enjoy it. Because, a chore would not make you want to do more of it. But if you enjoy it, you will want to do more, and do better at it.
