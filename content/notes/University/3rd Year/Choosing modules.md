title: "Choosing modules"

I might be considering an external module in 3rd year, given that I've chosen all the cs modules that I'm interested in.

I used to be against choosing non-cs modules, idk why, maybe I feel like, it would be useless for me to come to uni, to learn cs, but not take cs modules yk. But today, someone told me that modules in uni that are really worth taking is the hardware modules. Because, the software modules, you can learn it online from youtube or something. He said that, for the machine learning module, there's content on youtube that you can learn ML for like 2 weeks. Instead of like, a year ...  

So, yes, for 3rd year, I won't put the restriction of only taking cs modules on me. I will explore external modules that I find that will be useful. Or an external module, that will be an ez first, so that I'll have more free time to learn stuff on my own.
