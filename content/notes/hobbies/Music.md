I play the ukulele!  

I used to play 'gambang'(a wooden xylophone sort of, no it's not a marimba, it's gambang) in secondary school. I was a part of the gamelan team for my school. It was a nice 5 year thing going on. I never expected myself to be a musical person yk, but yea, when I left secondary school, I no longer play 'gambang' because it's a traditional musical equipment that I just don't have at home yk.  

But, the passion, it burns ... So, I decided to pick up an instrument. I played around with an electric keyboard I have at home(my mum bought it for my little brother). I can 'play' the first part of Fur Elise by memory, yes self taught. But I can't read sheet music quickly, and was quickly losing motivation. Then, I considered a guitar, but my mum told me a guitar is a bit too big for me(?) so she suggested a ukulele instead. So, because I don't know yet, if I would like a ukulele yk, so I used my college's music room's ukulele. I learned some basic chords. Went to the room almost every week, or uh every other day. XD. I realised that I can learn it fairly quickly, on my own! So I wanted one.   

So, we went to get my very first ukulele together, a concert ukulele. And that's when I got serious with it. And then my grandmother's sister gave me, a soprano ukulele! It was his son's, he doesn't use it. I discovered that, for my hands, a soprano ukulele is easier for me to play on, because it is smaller. So, it strains less on my fingers, and I can learn harder chords better on it. But I remember loving the sound of my concert ukulele more than my soprano ukulele.  

Then, I went uni! And I couldn't bring my ukelele with me to UK, because if I want to I have to buy a seat for it, and I can't afford that lmao. So, went UK without my uke. Then, few weeks in UK, I decided I'll go the nearest music shop in my area and get another uke! I got a teal soprano uke by Fender for 44quid! Best buy ever! I love it! I didn't really consider a concert ukulele while I was at the store, because I saw the *teal* one, so yea, I quickly decided that I want that one. XD  

I never expected to be playing the uke for about 2 years now, so that's nice. I enjoy playing my uke. And playing the uke forces me to sing, because I can't just play it without singing. I *need* to sing along with it to get better yk. It's all a part of the process. So, naturally, I am forced to learn to sing. I don't really think of myself as a person who *can* sing yk, but I guess, for the purpose of playing my uke, I can sing. Somewhat, idk. But yea. I love my uke, and I love learning new songs, love learning new strumming patterns and stuff. Love love it so much!  

A part of me still misses playing 'gambang', but it's fine. I have my uke now. :)  

Live music that I just LOVE:

	Currently I really love this one, it's making me want to have an electric guitar. Maybe one day, but for now, I'm learning the chords to this song, and the strumming pattern on my uke. I'll do a cover of it soon.
