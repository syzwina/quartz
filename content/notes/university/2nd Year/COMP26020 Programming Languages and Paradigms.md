A one year long module :weary:.  
Okay I just realised because Asma told me that this exam, is a 70% exam, of a 20 credit module. SO yea, quite important I'd say. Time to study ...    

# Part I : C and C++

Watching my lecturer's vids on c++, c++ is so cool omg. Yea, and I think Pavlos explained it really well. Pierre explained C really well as well. Would love to work with c++ more tbh.

# Part II : Haskel

Functional Programming ...
  
I LOVE Computerphile!

> It causes some problems for people learning languages like Haskell, because Haskell people tend to use the proper mathematical terms for things, and those terms are often quite foreign to programmers. And it does cause quite a lof of difficulty. So there's some people have the view that we shouldn't actually have used the term monad, maybe we should've called them effects, or something like that. So, just use the more kind of human, or a familliar term. But I'm actually of the point of view that, if we know the proper term for something, we should call it that something, and the people who are using it should just learn that term. I mean, it is what it is, it's a monad, and we should pay homage to the mathematicians for discovering this idea first, and not kind of reappropriate is as if it was discovered independently - the mathematicians discovered this, they should get credit for that, and so I'm quite happy with the word monad.

I think now I know why my Haskell code for one of the labs resulted in a stackoverflow ...  
Should've used Tail Recursive Algorithms.  

Just finished the exam ...  
I'm mad!  
The Haskell part is ugh, yea they did some lambda monad thing that I didn't understand. I didn't really dive deeper into monads because, in the lectures, the contents, monads were covered SO briefly.

This video made me understand a bit what was going on in the exam ...  
But it's over now ...  
Welp. Haskell is interesting indeed, but ugh how I hate that exam ...  


# Part III : Compilation

So much to remember HMMM.  
It's interesting tho, I always liked COMP11212 Fundamentals of Computation. And we revisit them in this module. But yea. Okay maybe *not too much* to remember, but it's still quite a bit much. Idk xD.  

# Part IV : Advanced Topics
Just concurrency stuff ...  
Solidity, Rust, etc.
