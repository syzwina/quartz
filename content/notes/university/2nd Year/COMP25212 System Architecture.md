This module is very interesting. However, I think I messed up 2 of the 3 courseworks I had.    

Finished this exam yesterday. Exam was exactly as expected. They gave us about 5 past papers and the exam is similar to that! Which is wonderful!  

Very good module, aside from me messing up the courseworks because of lack of time(or maybe more accurately, time management skills). Everything else is GOOD! Interesting content and very good exam! One of the nicest exam I've sat in for my degree I think.
