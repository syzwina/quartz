title: "Education Crisis"
---
Steps to overcome:
- measure the gap between recent research and practice 
	Early childhood education adalah satu kepakaran, guru-guru patut ada phd or masters. But this is not implemented in Malaysia.
	
	Research kata, abstract stuff can only be taught to people 10 years-old above. But kids in standard one are being taught abstract stuff in Malaysia.
	 
- track and follow up improvements
- use proper testing methods to students wether it is included in the school system or not
- balance interests of all parties
- fully utilise international level resource

TIL, we no longer have UPSR for kids?  
Malaysia has always been an exam oriented country, teachers are trained to track kids with exams. But without having any exams, and teachers are not being trained to deal with this situation. Idk anymore.  

Krisis pendidikan kita ni, sampai orang dah tak nak belajar dah. Which is very not good.

This is not a good sign for a country.

Dulu, UPSR adalah hanya untuk bezakan student yang master skill asal ke tak. But as time goes by, it became a competition, how many As. And determines budak tu masuk sbp or not. So it became a very detrimental thing for weaker students. But, without having any exams at all, there's no way to see how well our kids are doing.

Things we can do:
- read books about early childhood education
- send kids to tadika yang buat early childhood education
  
Things to look for in kids:
- keprihatinan terhadap kesusahan orang lain
- peka
- akhlak dengan orang lain
- not just handing in homeworks and grades
  
Kat Malaysia, cikgu semua ajar subjeck lain-lain. Tapi kalau kat UK, cikgu yang sama ajar banyak subjects. So, budak-budak darjah satu, yang tak reti nak link kan all of these information, can link them up with the help of the teachers. Kids yag dah older, budak2 sekolah menengah, no longer need the same teacher for multiple subjects, because their brains have matured.
  
Education sepatutnya, mengeluarkan seseorang yang susah daripada situasi yang susah itu. tapi education Malaysia kini, graduan di Malaysia, tidak mampu mengeluarkan Malaysia daripada kesusahan. 
  
Kini, students are taught things that they don't need to learn. Also, they're taught in inefficient methods. For example, Pendidikan Islam is taught in Jawi, without knowing if the kid knows Jawi or not. You're just making it harder for the kid to learn. Thus, making it them hate that subject.
