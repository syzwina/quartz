title: "Education Crisis"
---
Steps to overcome:
- measure the gap between recent research and practice 
	Early childhood education adalah satu kepakaran, guru-guru patut ada phd or masters. But this is not implemented in Malaysia.
	
	Research kata, abstract stuff can only be taught to people 10 years-old above. But kids in standard one are being taught abstract stuff in Malaysia.
	 
- track and follow up improvements
- use proper testing methods to students wether it is included in the school system or not
- balance interests of all parties
- fully utilise international level resource

TIL, we no longer have UPSR for kids?  
Malaysia has always been an exam oriented country, teachers are trained to track kids with exams. But without having any exams, and teachers are not being trained to deal with this situation. Idk anymore.  

Krisis pendidikan kita ni, sampai orang dah tak nak belajar dah. Which is very not good.

This is not a good sign for a country.

Dulu, UPSR adalah hanya untuk bezakan student yang master skill asal ke tak. But as time goes by, it became a competition, how many As. And determines budak tu masuk sbp or not. So it became a very detrimental thing for weaker students. But, without having any exams at all, there's no way to see how well our kids are doing.

- send kids to tadika yang buat early childhood education
