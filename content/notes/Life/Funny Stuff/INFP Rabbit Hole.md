[INFP Is The Best Type And Here's Why](https://youtu.be/knEF-jjaso8)  

I love how I had a thought 'hmm, i want to do crochet' and then milliseconds later, the video says crochet :sob:  
Read my mind fr  

I love how the writings, are not even centered. Kinda want to do the same on a vlog/cover now xD.  


OHMYGOD.  
Just *too accurate.*  
I retake mbti tests so much. Too much.  
But yea, every time it says I'm an INFP, except that one time, ISFP. But just once.  
Every other time, INFP all the way. xD
