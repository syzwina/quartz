From this, wow, I really felt what he said ever since I [[notes/Life/So I Deleted Social Media|deleted social media]]. I noticed myself being very bored at some points in the day, and then I owuld find something to do. Most times, I decided to cook something, sometimes I read. Sometimes, I decided to take out my laptop and watch YouTube videos. Sometimes, I even decided to work because I'm just so bored and work is better than being bored you know. Which is an interesting prospect, because in those moments, I *chose* to work, I wasn't forced to work. I willingly chose to do it. Sometimes, I decide to pick up a new hobby, or just pick up an old hobby again. Yea.
