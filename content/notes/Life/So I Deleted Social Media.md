I deleted social media! (deactivated 2 instagram accounts, main and second account and 1 facebook account) I don't really use facebook, but I link them with both my instagrams because elders in my family use facebook more, so just want to keep them up to date with me.  

But, not anymore, I don't want anyone to be up to date with me anymore. uHM. Yea.  
Might be a phase, but in doing so, I also decluttered my phone. I un-installed *a lot*  of apps on my phone, ones that I never use really. Now my phone looks, uHM, bland. But it's okay. Tbf it's only been 5 days, so I'm doing fine *for now*. But we'll see. I'll update here whenever I want to say something about it.   

Things I've noticed:
- In social settings, whenever I don't feel like talking, I uh, can't do anything on my phone, cus I have nothing ...  I mean, I can read my e-books, but idk.
  But usually, I reach out to instagram. I reach out to instagram throughout the day tbh, so not having instagram anymore gives me nothing to do in such situations, so I am somewhat forced to be present.  
- Like I said, I reach out for instagram throughout the day, I mainly posts stuff. uHM, *overshare* yea. So, not having that no longer makes me overshare stuff. 
- I go to youtube more now. But, I *just* deleted youtube after seeing this video [one year off social media, an update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmhQTebjgmA), so we'll see how it goes. Plan is, to only watch youtube on my laptop, so I would be more mindful on what I watch, instead of just going on youtube shorts.
