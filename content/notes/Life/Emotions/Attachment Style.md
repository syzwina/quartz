UhM, so I thought I was a secure attachment style, but maybe I am an avoidant attachment style?  
Not too sure, am doing some research about it atm, will update here.

# Avoidant

[10 Signs You Might Have An Avoidant Attachment Style](https://youtu.be/9iH1aoxl-R0)
- [x] You take radical responsibility for your life
- [ ] You often feel intense pressure in intimate relationships
- [ ] You feel most comfortable making major life decisions alone
- [ ] You'd rather meet practical needs rather than emotional ones
- [x] You can outsource your 'wants' but not your needs
- [x] When your feelings are hurt, you tend to retreat to process, rather than reach out to repair
      uHM, very guilty of this
      I notice myself heading home almost immediately in a day goes badly, to a point where me going home suddenly is normal to my friends
      I just need *alone time* when I feel really bad about something, sad, angry, upset, etc.
- [ ] You struggle to find adequately independent partners
- [x] You are highly protective over your time and space
- [x] You rarely feel emotionally vulnerable
      I only mostly, feel amotonally vulnerable when I'm with myself, so yea 
- [x] You show love by not putting your needs on others
      uHM, this is so true, even between me and my family and friends
      I truly think, not burdening someone with your problems is an act of love, it's true tho
      Why would I make someone elese worry about *my* problems, and I shouldn't have to worry about *their* problems
      Now that I'm writing this down, this sounds selfish to me, but idk

# Secure

- [ ] You are comfortable asking for help
      uHM, nope
- [ ] You don't take things personally
      yea i tend to flee when people are stressed
      thus why in extreme uni conditions, i stay at home, to avoid the stressed people
  - [ ] You conciously adapt your approach to different relationships
       i do notice, i don't like people who tend to show strong emotions
       my brain immediately judges them as unable to handle themselves
