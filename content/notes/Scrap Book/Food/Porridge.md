title: "Porridge"

I've been having porridges, the *savoury* kind cus I'm asian, for the past month ...  
I tend to like something, and only make/eat those for the next month. This time it's porridge. The chicken there are just air fried chicken because it's the easiest for me atm. I marinate  those chicken in salt, vinegar, tumeric powder and chilli powder. I bring these to uni, and have them for dinner at home. Yea, somewhat like a meal prep but in a way that I like and easy for me.
