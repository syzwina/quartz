Duncan\n\nThis is one of my favouite series of all time. My favourite character, Malachiasz Czechowicz is from this series. I still do think about him sometimes. He's a very interesting character. Knowingly evil, purely evil but, I don't feel hatred towards him. His backstory makes it understandable, to me, for him to be that way. I have a tendency to adore villains in stories, especially when I feel like they are misunderstood.  \n\nIt's funny how, the way I came across this series is so coincidental. I went shopping with my dad one time, and the shop were selling out books, for RM5. That is, VERY cheap! And I bought Blessed Monsters. Not knowing that it was the 3rd book of the trilogy. Imagine the feeling of finding out a book you just bought is a part of a trilogy, and it's the LAST book of the trilogy at that. Welp, I(well not me, my parents) ended up spending more than RM5 for the other 2 books xD. But it's a book that really got me hooked. So, 100% worth it!  \n\nHere's some quotes from the series that I really really love:\n\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Nadezhda Lapteva\n\u003e \n\u003e I lost my goddess and I lost Malachiasz and I think the thing worse than being pulled in two different directions is having both suddenly vanish. There's nothing left.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Blessed Monsters\n\u003e \n\u003e \"Sleep.\" Serefin said, not wanting to know. \n\u003e \"Our problems will be here in the morning.\"\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Blessed Monsters\n\u003e \n\u003e \"But I'm so handsome.\" Serefin whined.\n\u003e \"I am so sorry to be the one to tell you this, truly the words are acid on my tounge, but he is too.\" Kacper replied solemnly. \n\u003e Serefin clutched his chest. Malachiasz grinned.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Blessed Monsters\n\u003e \n\u003e \"You're making the right decision.\" Milomir said to Serefin, voice low.\n\u003e \"Almost certainly not, but we'll see, won't we?\" Serefin returned, easily.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Serefin Meleski\n\u003e \n\u003e Czijow, brother of mine.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Malachiasz Czechowicz\n\u003e \n\u003e Prszystem, towy dzimyka.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Blessed Monsters\n\u003e \n\u003e \"Dead again?\" \"Dead again!\" Velyos said.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Serefin Meleski\n\u003e \n\u003e Then we fight back. Mortal and broken, as we are.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Serefin Meleski\n\u003e \n\u003e I'm sick of this dying business. Never again.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Nadezhda Lapteva\n\u003e \n\u003e She wanted Malachiasz's hand cradling the back of her head. Wanted him to lean over her shoulder to scoff at her Codex. To see the intense look on his face as he was curled over his spell book, the look that she now knew meant he was sketching.\n\u003e \n\u003e She wanted to spend another afternoon in a library with Serefin, him spending th first hour complaining that every book he picked up was too dry before one finally caught his attention, and his wine, for once, went unattended to.\n\u003e \n\u003e She wanted another evening with Parijahan, drinking tea while she braidd Nadya's hair, cajoling Rashid to tell them stories if he insisted on hanging around.\n\u003e \n\u003e Quite moments of humanity with those she loved so dearly.\n\u003e \n\u003e Power wasn't worth losing that.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Blessed Monsters\n\u003e \n\u003e \"If I were to give you orders, would you listen to me?\"\n\u003e \"You're the king,\" she said, sounding puzzled.\n\u003e \"You also outrank me.\"\n\u003e Serefin grinned. \"I do! I outrank everyone!\"\n\u003e Kacper closed his eyes briefly.\n\u003e \"I thought you had considered that walking here.\"\n\u003e \"I hadn't!\"\n\u003e \"We don't have time for this,\" Malachiasz muttered.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Blessed Monsters\n\u003e \n\u003e \"At least we won't have to worry about that after we're all devoured by this deity of entropy.\"\n\u003e \"Serefin, so good of you to be optimistic,\" Nadya said.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Malachiasz Czechowicz\n\u003e \n\u003e They chose to be human; they chose to live.\n\u003e And so, they chose to die.\n\nSome bits of the language used in this series is quite hard for me to understand, because I think it is a Slavic language? I'm not too sure tbh. But what I do know is that, `towy dzimyka` means little bird, which is also Malachiasz's nickname to Nadya.\n\nAs you can see there's quite a few quotes from Serefin. I love him. Basically I have 4 favourite characters from this book, Malachiasz, Nadezhda(Nadya), Serefin and Kacper. I love their dynamic for some reason. I love Serefin's wittiness xD.\n\nBased on my understanding, this series is heavily influenced by Hinduism, hence with the multiple gods. I never thought I would read such a book, because I am indeed muslim. It was very weird at first, but something about it kept me going, and I'm glad I did. It was an emotional roller coaster fr.\n\nI remember waking up at around 4:00am back in my hometown, reading this, and when my grandma saw me she was confused. And when she told my mum about it the next day, my mum just brushed it off as if it was normal, I mean it is normal for me, but yea. I'm getting very nerdy now ik lmao ...

This is a 100% coursework module, which involved 9 exercises, 4 of them are coursework submissions. Each of them are worth 20 marks.  \n\nLast week, I submitted exercise 5, exercise 7 and exercise 9. All in a week.  \n\nYes, it was an interesting week, I've been waking up early, around 5:00am each day. Which is very doable at this time of the year since the sun is up at like 4:30am. I woke up mainly because I can't sleep when it's bright anyway, make myself food, and work on the 3 submissions. I would not have been in this position if I didn't skip most of the labs for this module tbh.  \n\nEarlier this semester, I was having so much fun in this module. I really love it, that's why I've taken it. There's only around 50 people taking this module, and out of those, who are girls, I think it was just 8 people, me included. But point being, I took it because I was very interested(I still am) in hardware stuff.   \n\nTechnically this is not really a hardware module, we worked with an FPGA, wrote ARM assembly code on it. Learned stuff like SVCs, IRQs and basic ARM assembly stuff. The closest we get to hardware is in exercise 8, where we have to design an IO driver with Cadence to use a buzzer, which is already on the board.  \n\nBut back to my main point, I was having a lot of fun, but what happened? Why did I stop going to labs? After submitting the last exercise yesterday, I went home feeling very happy and proud. This week, despite being very hectic because of the workload, I find myself not as stressed as I should be(for someone who has a week to catch up with 50% of the module's workload). I really do enjoy coding in assembly and working with low level stuff.  \n\nThe thing that is stopping me from going to labs is, really, myself. Cliche ik. But fr, this can't go on much longer. Basically what happened was, I had a very bad week of PMS around the middle of the semester, when exercise 5 was supposedly due(we had flexible deadlines for this module, which I suspect is one of the reasons this happened). My mood was at an all time low for the whole week. I basically didn't go to uni at all because I just can't.  \n\nBut I should be able to get back to work after the PMS phase passed. Because I was fine for every other module. But not Microcontrollers. I could not bring myself to go the labs. I was stuck in exercise 5, where we had to interface with a timer, and I felt like everyone else was ahead of me. It wasn't even that hard now that I think about it. But yea, I find myself not wanting to ask for help. And I felt ashamed of being stuck on something.  \n\nI don't mind being stuck on something sometimes, it is fun to solve problems. That is why I love coding. The bliss you feel when you fixed some bug, or make something work, is just wonderful. But what I don't like is asking for help. I really struggle with that. A friend of mine, Asma K pointed that out to me in first semester. We were in a sub-team for our Software Engineering II module. We were stuck, and I was very reluctant to ask for help. That was when I first learned of this 'trait' I have. And I still struggle with it.  \n\nI think, I really don't like asking for help because, it makes me feel small, weak. I don't like that feeling. But, last week, I asked for help. I found myself having to give myself peptalks before I go up to someone and ask for help. I asked Sarah, one of the girls who takes the module on how to scan the keyboard they gave us, because the documentation for it was very poor, and I could not understand it even after reading it MULTIPLE times. I was very hesitant. Because that was the first time I needed help for last week's coursework catching up session. I think I wasted about 30 minutes pondering if I should go up to her and ask the question. When I did finally ask her, she explained it to me nicely and simply, and I was unstuck, I knew what to do at that point. Let me tell you, it felt like an achievement!  \n\nAnd then, I was stuck a couple more times, but each time I had to ask something, I take less time pondering if I should ask. It was like 'Just Go And ASK!' and I asked more stuff. I think I really take pride in not asking for too much help. So the fact that I asked and she responded very kindly really made me happy and made me so very grateful. That was with exercise 7.  \n\nExercise 8, we had to use Cadence. See, I've worked with Cadence before in first semester, so I thought, I must be able to do it in a day right? No. When I asked Dan, if it is anything like first semester and he said no, my heart dropped. I missed the lab where they taught us how to use it and it was entirely my fault. But Dan offered to help, without me even asking, :sob: I was crying internally by then because I don't have to muster up more energy and courage to ask for help. I am so very grateful to Dan, to Sarah, to everyone who helped me, and willingly at that.  \n\nDan helped me lots with exercise 8, but despite that I was still stuck with something. So, I was hoping that I can seek help from the TAs the next day, since I have a lab on that day. And alhamdulillah it was resolved, I REALLY wish there's better documentation for softwares such as Cadence because how would I know that I need to edit the name of the GND to have a \u003c7:0\u003e at the end to change it from a 1-bit ground to an 8-bit ground? But yea, should've gone to the lab right?  \n\nBut all my issues were resolved by then, and I was happily coding my final project(exercise 9), learning about PWM and having some very nice insightful conversations with the lecturers and TAs there. And at the end of the day, I submitted exercise 9 at 6:03pm Friday and I am very proud of it. I might go to my lab next Monday, and see if Jim has marked my exercise 7, and get feedback so that I can fix any issues and refactor my code. There's a lot more to improve obviously, more comments to add, and I should use the classic ARM calling conventions, but that takes time and I am not sure if I want to invest my time in that because I have a System Architecture exam next Wednesday.   \n\n\u003e[!abstract] TLDR\n\u003e\n\u003eA conclusion to all this, was that I learned a lot of lessons. Never skip labs just because you don't want to go, or because you felt overwhelmed, or because you felt intimidated. And ask for help when you need it, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to not know everything. These things, for me especially, are easier said than done, but I'm learning to overcome it. Slowly, but surely.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-15T19:14:13.832172012Z","tags":[]},"/notes/university/2nd-Year/COMP25212-System-Architecture":{"title":"COMP25212 System Architecture","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-05-15T19:14:13.832172012Z","tags":[]},"/notes/university/University":{"title":"University","content":"\nYes, I am a university student.  \nI study MEng Computer Science in The University of Manchester.  \n\n[[notes/university/2nd Year/2nd Year|2nd Year]]  ","lastmodified":"2023-05-15T19:14:13.832172012Z","tags":[]}}
