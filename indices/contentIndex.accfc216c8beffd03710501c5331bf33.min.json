He said he cried in an airplane reading this book.  \n\nPersonally, this book, for me, was a bit bland. I didn't cry, I didn't feel any extreme emotions. I feel like, the character introductions and storyline were so brief, that I couldn't build an emotional connection with their sorrows and concerns. It's a nice short book though. But I know myself, I tend to not really like short books, because of the reason I stated above. Yea.\n\n\u003e[!QUOTE]\n\u003e\n\u003e “The cafe that transports you back in time.

It's a REALLY GOOD BOOK, but I was just struggling out of my reading slump by then. I really love the way the writer portrays the scene and the emotions each character was feeling.  \n\nI picked this one up, with *no expectations*. So I was really surprised to see Islamic terms showing up in the book. Turns out this series is highly influenced by the middle eastern culture and such. Very good book! Highly recommend!  \n\nI really want to write down all the quotes for this book, but I sent the book home when my parents came to the UK to visit me. So yea, I'll write it down this summer hopefully.\n# Dune Messiah, Dune #2\nI am reading this one currently, although I may have stopped for a bit due to exams(well actually no, not because of exams, I just don't feel like reading these days). But yea, will come back to it soon.  \n\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Scytale\n\u003e \n\u003e Reason is the first victim of strong emotion\n\nVery true! When I feel something so strongly. I would try my best(in my mind, or in my journal) to reason *why* I feel that way and to reason whether it is valid or not. Yea, but reason is often clouded when you feel strong emotions. That's why, when time passes, and I re-read the journal entry I made when I was feeling the emotions. I have a more outward view of how I was feeling back then. Sometimes I feel stupid for feeling stuff, but sometimes, I can see why I feel that way and it taught me, how to think, the next time I feel such an emotion. How to cope better. How to react better. Yea, stuff like that.  \n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] \n\u003e \n\u003e 'I do not like the way you smile,' ...  Mohiam  \n\u003e 'And I think less of what pleases you ...' Scytale \n\nSavage :weary:  \n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Paul's Father (Duke Leto of Atreidis)\n\u003e \n\u003e 'One who rules assumes irrevocable responsibility for the ruled. You are a husbandman. This demands at times, a selfless act of love which may only be amusing to those you rule.'\n\nThis made me think, that love is indeed, a selfless act. Like how an apology is a selfless act. Love is as well.  \n\nThat reminds me how, when we want to be loved, often times we would want the other to accept us as a whole, flaws and all. And in return we will accept their flaws as well. And how can it get more selfless than that?  \n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Paul\n\u003e \n\u003e Part of her hold on him lay in the fact that he so seldom needed his tension-building powers with her. Chani mostly avoided indiscreet questions. She maintained a Freemen sense of good manners. Hers were more often practical questions. What interested Chani were facts which bore on the position of her man - his strength in Council, the loyalty of his legions, the abilities and talents of his allies. Her memory held catalogs of names and cross-indexed details. She could rattle off the major weakness of every known enemy, the potential dispositions of opposing forces, battle plans of their military leaders, the tooling and production capacities of basic industries.\n\nChani reminds me of the tales of women in Islam. Very inspirational. A very capable woman. Not just a 'princess' as we're often told in western tales. However, this is not a feminist pov. She is capable yes, but that doesn't mean that she takes the jobs of men. She has her own role, such as leading the women in her sietch and ultimately helping Paul go through difficulties. They support each other.    \n","lastmodified":"2023-05-30T14:54:23.899951793Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Books/How-To-Make-Friends-With-The-Dark":{"title":"How To Make Friends With The Dark","content":"\nAuthor: Kathleen Glasgow  \n\nI think this book is a famous one.

Because you know, we will all go through it one day. But I wasn't expecting to feel those emotions, as if they were my own. I cried so much reading this book. And I'm not even halfway yet. I will pick this book up again soon. I will finish it. It's a really good book.

Duncan\n\nThis is one of my favouite series of all time. My favourite character, Malachiasz Czechowicz is from this series. I still do think about him sometimes. He's a very interesting character. Knowingly evil, purely evil but, I don't feel hatred towards him. His backstory makes it understandable, to me, for him to be that way. I have a tendency to adore villains in stories, especially when I feel like they are misunderstood.  \n\nIt's funny how, the way I came across this series is so coincidental. I went shopping with my dad one time, and the shop were selling out books, for RM5. That is, VERY cheap! And I bought Blessed Monsters. Not knowing that it was the 3rd book of the trilogy. Imagine the feeling of finding out a book you just bought is a part of a trilogy, and it's the LAST book of the trilogy at that. Welp, I(well not me, my parents) ended up spending more than RM5 for the other 2 books xD. But it's a book that really got me hooked. So, 100% worth it!  \n\nHere's some quotes from the series that I really really love:\n\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Nadezhda Lapteva\n\u003e \n\u003e I lost my goddess and I lost Malachiasz and I think the thing worse than being pulled in two different directions is having both suddenly vanish.

Malachiasz grinned.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Blessed Monsters\n\u003e \n\u003e \"You're making the right decision.\" Milomir said to Serefin, voice low.\n\u003e \"Almost certainly not, but we'll see, won't we?\" Serefin returned, easily.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Serefin Meleski\n\u003e \n\u003e Czijow, brother of mine.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Malachiasz Czechowicz\n\u003e \n\u003e Prszystem, towy dzimyka.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Blessed Monsters\n\u003e \n\u003e \"Dead again?\" \"Dead again!\" Velyos said.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Serefin Meleski\n\u003e \n\u003e Then we fight back.

To see the intense look on his face as he was curled over his spell book, the look that she now knew meant he was sketching.\n\u003e \n\u003e She wanted to spend another afternoon in a library with Serefin, him spending th first hour complaining that every book he picked up was too dry before one finally caught his attention, and his wine, for once, went unattended to.\n\u003e \n\u003e She wanted another evening with Parijahan, drinking tea while she braidd Nadya's hair, cajoling Rashid to tell them stories if he insisted on hanging around.\n\u003e \n\u003e Quite moments of humanity with those she loved so dearly.\n\u003e \n\u003e Power wasn't worth losing that.\n\n\u003e [!QUOTE] Blessed Monsters\n\u003e \n\u003e \"If I were to give you orders, would you listen to me?\"\n\u003e \"You're the king,\" she said, sounding puzzled.\n\u003e \"You also outrank me.\"\n\u003e Serefin grinned. \"I do!

I'm not too sure tbh. But what I do know is that, `towy dzimyka` means little bird, which is also Malachiasz's nickname to Nadya.\n\nAs you can see there's quite a few quotes from Serefin. I love him. Basically I have 4 favourite characters from this book, Malachiasz, Nadezhda(Nadya), Serefin and Kacper. I love their dynamic for some reason. I love Serefin's wittiness xD.\n\nBased on my understanding, this series is heavily influenced by Hinduism, hence with the multiple gods. I never thought I would read such a book, because I am indeed muslim. It was very weird at first, but something about it kept me going, and I'm glad I did. It was an emotional roller coaster fr.\n\nI remember waking up at around 4:00am back in my hometown, reading this, and when my grandma saw me she was confused. And when she told my mum about it the next day, my mum just brushed it off as if it was normal, I mean it is normal for me, but yea. I'm getting very nerdy now ik lmao ...

Idk how, idk why, but yea, it's an ongoing pattern I see myself fall into *every* exam season ...  \n\nIt doesn't happen in coursework season tho. But courseworks are stressfull as well. But I think(my hypothesis) it is because, for courseworks, it is inherently creative in nature? So I don't feel the need to get it(the creative energy I mean) out in a different way. But with exams, it's not really creative, it's memory recall intensive. So the creative energy builds up? Idk.

Idk, maybe I am just in denial.  \n\nBut yea, I pick up some new hobbies randomly, and at times I'll go back to an old hobby. It's like I have a cycle of stuff I like to do, and I go through it throughout my life. Some days I don't feel like playing my uke, but I feel like drawing. Some days, I don't want to do anything but cook. Yea, I'm sure some people can relate to that right? Yea.

I was a part of the gamelan team for my school. It was a nice 5 year thing going on. I never expected myself to be a musical person yk, but yea, when I left secondary school, I no longer play 'gambang' because it's a traditional musical equipment that I just don't have at home yk.  \n\nBut, the passion, it burns ... So, I decided to pick up an instrument. I played around with an electric keyboard I have at home(my mum bought it for my little brother). I can 'play' the first part of Fur Elise by memory, yes self taught. But I can't read sheet music quickly, and was quickly losing motivation. Then, I considered a guitar, but my mum told me a guitar is a bit too big for me(?) so she suggested a ukulele instead. So, because I don't know yet, if I would like a ukulele yk, so I used my college's music room's ukulele. I learned some basic chords. Went to the room almost every week, or uh every other day. XD. I realised that I can learn it fairly quickly, on my own! So I wanted one.   \n\nSo, we went to get my very first ukulele together, a concert ukulele. And that's when I got serious with it. And then my grandmother's sister gave me, a soprano ukulele! It was his son's, he doesn't use it. I discovered that, for my hands, a soprano ukulele is easier for me to play on, because it is smaller. So, it strains less on my fingers, and I can learn harder chords better on it. But I remember loving the sound of my concert ukulele more than my soprano ukulele.  \n\nThen, I went uni! And I couldn't bring my ukelele with me to UK, because if I want to I have to buy a seat for it, and I can't afford that lmao. So, went UK without my uke. Then, few weeks in UK, I decided I'll go the nearest music shop in my area and get another uke! I got a teal soprano uke by Fender for 44quid! Best buy ever! I love it! I didn't really consider a concert ukulele while I was at the store, because I saw the *teal* one, so yea, I quickly decided that I want that one. XD  \n\nI never expected to be playing the uke for about 2 years now, so that's nice. I enjoy playing my uke. And playing the uke forces me to sing, because I can't just play it without singing. I *need* to sing along with it to get better yk. It's all a part of the process. So, naturally, I am forced to learn to sing. I don't really think of myself as a person who *can* sing yk, but I guess, for the purpose of playing my uke, I can sing. Somewhat, idk. But yea. I love my uke, and I love learning new songs, love learning new strumming patterns and stuff. Love love it so much!  \n\nA part of me still misses playing 'gambang', but it's fine. I have my uke now. :)  \n\nLive music that I just LOVE:  \n- [Cavetown - Boys Will Be Bugs [Official Live at Hoxton Hall]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c31Fd0QFNLE)\n\tCurrently I really love this one, it's making me want to have an electric guitar. Maybe one day, but for now, I'm learning the chords to this song, and the strumming pattern on my uke. I'll do a cover of it soon.   \n\tChords: [Boys Will Be Bugs Chords](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cavetown/boys-will-be-bugs-chords-2541447)\n- I love most of Panic! At The Disco's live! I am quite sad I didn't go to their last concert :( But I had stuff going on at that time, so yea, nvm, I can still watch them on youtube. \n\tI love it when Brandon sings the high notes so well!\n- [take me to church - hozier (cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRcdEB6uSsQ)\n\tI love love chloe moriondo's covers, especially this one. I love seeing other people's vocal torture(uh what?) ... And I aspire to be able to do the same one day :)   \n\nLive concert I've been to:  \n- The Vamps, 10 Years with The Vamps tour  \n\tMy first ever concert. I really enjoyed it. I love the loud music(altho I had to wear ear plugs). It was nice listening to my favourite songs live XD.

But I just eat it anyways despite it not rising, still tastes good tho, so yea.  \n- To have it perfectly round sizes, pour the batter into a 3/4 measuring cup, on a hot pan, pour the batter from the measuring cup in the middle of the pan, and let it expand into a circle on its own. Once the batter starts looking bubbly, flip it! And you'll have nice consistently sized pancakes!

This is a 100% coursework module, which involved 9 exercises, 4 of them are coursework submissions. Each of them are worth 20 marks.  \n\nLast week, I submitted exercise 5, exercise 7 and exercise 9. All in a week.  \n\nYes, it was an interesting week, I've been waking up early, around 5:00am each day. Which is very doable at this time of the year since the sun is up at like 4:30am. I woke up mainly because I can't sleep when it's bright anyway, make myself food, and work on the 3 submissions. I would not have been in this position if I didn't skip most of the labs for this module tbh.  \n\nEarlier this semester, I was having so much fun in this module. I really love it, that's why I've taken it. There's only around 50 people taking this module, and out of those, who are girls, I think it was just 8 people, me included. But point being, I took it because I was very interested(I still am) in hardware stuff.   \n\nTechnically this is not really a hardware module, we worked with an FPGA, wrote ARM assembly code on it. Learned stuff like SVCs, IRQs and basic ARM assembly stuff. The closest we get to hardware is in exercise 8, where we have to design an IO driver with Cadence to use a buzzer, which is already on the board.  \n\nBut back to my main point, I was having a lot of fun, but what happened? Why did I stop going to labs? After submitting the last exercise yesterday, I went home feeling very happy and proud. This week, despite being very hectic because of the workload, I find myself not as stressed as I should be(for someone who has a week to catch up with 50% of the module's workload). I really do enjoy coding in assembly and working with low level stuff.  \n\nThe thing that is stopping me from going to labs is, really, myself. Cliche ik. But fr, this can't go on much longer. Basically what happened was, I had a very bad week of PMS around the middle of the semester, when exercise 5 was supposedly due(we had flexible deadlines for this module, which I suspect is one of the reasons this happened). My mood was at an all time low for the whole week. I basically didn't go to uni at all because I just can't.  \n\nBut I should be able to get back to work after the PMS phase passed. Because I was fine for every other module. But not Microcontrollers. I could not bring myself to go the labs. I was stuck in exercise 5, where we had to interface with a timer, and I felt like everyone else was ahead of me. It wasn't even that hard now that I think about it. But yea, I find myself not wanting to ask for help. And I felt ashamed of being stuck on something.  \n\nI don't mind being stuck on something sometimes, it is fun to solve problems. That is why I love coding. The bliss you feel when you fixed some bug, or make something work, is just wonderful. But what I don't like is asking for help. I really struggle with that. A friend of mine, Asma K pointed that out to me in first semester. We were in a sub-team for our Software Engineering II module. We were stuck, and I was very reluctant to ask for help. That was when I first learned of this 'trait' I have. And I still struggle with it.  \n\nI think, I really don't like asking for help because, it makes me feel small, weak. I don't like that feeling. But, last week, I asked for help. I found myself having to give myself peptalks before I go up to someone and ask for help. I asked Sarah, one of the girls who takes the module on how to scan the keyboard they gave us, because the documentation for it was very poor, and I could not understand it even after reading it MULTIPLE times. I was very hesitant. Because that was the first time I needed help for last week's coursework catching up session. I think I wasted about 30 minutes pondering if I should go up to her and ask the question. When I did finally ask her, she explained it to me nicely and simply, and I was unstuck, I knew what to do at that point. Let me tell you, it felt like an achievement!  \n\nAnd then, I was stuck a couple more times, but each time I had to ask something, I take less time pondering if I should ask. It was like 'Just Go And ASK!' and I asked more stuff. I think I really take pride in not asking for too much help. So the fact that I asked and she responded very kindly really made me happy and made me so very grateful. That was with exercise 7.  \n\nExercise 8, we had to use Cadence. See, I've worked with Cadence before in first semester, so I thought, I must be able to do it in a day right? No. When I asked Dan, if it is anything like first semester and he said no, my heart dropped. I missed the lab where they taught us how to use it and it was entirely my fault. But Dan offered to help, without me even asking, :sob: I was crying internally by then because I don't have to muster up more energy and courage to ask for help. I am so very grateful to Dan, to Sarah, to everyone who helped me, and willingly at that.  \n\nDan helped me lots with exercise 8, but despite that I was still stuck with something. So, I was hoping that I can seek help from the TAs the next day, since I have a lab on that day. And alhamdulillah it was resolved, I REALLY wish there's better documentation for softwares such as Cadence because how would I know that I need to edit the name of the GND to have a \u003c7:0\u003e at the end to change it from a 1-bit ground to an 8-bit ground? But yea, should've gone to the lab right?  \n\nBut all my issues were resolved by then, and I was happily coding my final project(exercise 9), learning about PWM and having some very nice insightful conversations with the lecturers and TAs there. And at the end of the day, I submitted exercise 9 at 6:03pm Friday and I am very proud of it. I might go to my lab next Monday, and see if Jim has marked my exercise 7, and get feedback so that I can fix any issues and refactor my code. There's a lot more to improve obviously, more comments to add, and I should use the classic ARM calling conventions, but that takes time and I am not sure if I want to invest my time in that because I have a System Architecture exam next Wednesday.   \n\n\u003e[!abstract] TLDR\n\u003e\n\u003eA conclusion to all this, was that I learned a lot of lessons. Never skip labs just because you don't want to go, or because you felt overwhelmed, or because you felt intimidated. And ask for help when you need it, it's okay to ask for help, it's okay to not know everything. These things, for me especially, are easier said than done, but I'm learning to overcome it. Slowly, but surely.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-30T14:54:23.903951895Z","tags":[]},"/notes/University/2nd-Year/COMP25212-System-Architecture":{"title":"COMP25212 System Architecture","content":"This module is very interesting. However, I think I messed up 2 of the 3 courseworks I had.    \n\n**Thursday, May 18th 2023  \n2:41 pm**\n\nFinished this exam yesterday. Exam was exactly as expected. They gave us about 5 past papers and the exam was similar to that! Which was wonderful!  \n\nVery good module, aside from me messing up the courseworks because of the lack of time(or maybe more accurately, time management skills). Everything else is GOOD! Interesting content and very good exam! One of the nicest exam I've sat in for my degree I think.  \n\nIn preparing for the exam, I wasn't panicking. Which I think was a really good way to go, because that meant, me trying to *actually understand stuff*   instead of just cramming stuff into my head(altho I must say, I started studying for this exam 2 days before the exam, BUT I was caught up with content even before exam season started, that's why I was chill). I found this really COOL YouTube channel, [Intermation](https://www.youtube.com/@Intermation)! This channel helped me understand how to disect an address to give us the tag bits, index bits and the offset bits(which came out in the exam btw!). And I also learnt more about Hamming Codes and ECC(Error Correction Code) from this channel.  \n\nAlthough my lecturer did cover this in the lectures we had, but seeing it visually, in a very well thought  through video really helped solidify my understanding. 100% recommend!  \n\nIt's odd really, but I think this module made us do some maths. Maths that felt like A-Level maths :sob:. Which I really really miss. You know, working with SI units, and multiplying stuff to get some other stuff like IPC(instruction per cycle) and computing throughput(Instruction per second) based on a CPU's clock frequency. I must admit, I enjoyed the exam, because I get to calculate stuff xD.

And it does cause quite a lof of difficulty. So there's some people have the view that we shouldn't actually have used the term monad, maybe we should've called them effects, or something like that. So, just use the more kind of human, or a familliar term. But I'm actually of the point of view that, if we know the proper term for something, we should call it that something, and the people who are using it should just learn that term. I mean, it is what it is, it's a monad, and we should pay homage to the mathematicians for discovering this idea first, and not kind of reappropriate is as if it was discovered independently - the mathematicians discovered this, they should get credit for that, and so I'm quite happy with the word monad.\n\n[Haskell for Imperative Programmers #3 - Recursion, Guards, Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6xiaSkVlvs\u0026list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV\u0026index=3)  \nI think now I know why my Haskell code for one of the labs resulted in a stackoverflow ...  \nShould've used Tail Recursive Algorithms.  \n\nJust finished the exam ...  \nI'm mad!  \nThe Haskell part is ugh, yea they did some lambda monad thing that I didn't understand.

Making yourself a good meal won't take that long. All these would boost your mood and make you happy. And if you're happy or in an overall good mood, you can study!  \n\nAnd making sure you are happy while studying is important, because you don't want 'studying' to be a chore. You want to be able to enjoy it. Because, a chore would not make you want to do more of it. But if you enjoy it, you will want to do more, and do better at it.
